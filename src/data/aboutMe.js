    introduction: 
        "Mabuhay! I'm Dion Areglo, a Frontend Developer from the Philippines who loves turning complex problems into simple, beautiful designs. My journey into Web Development started with a curiosity for how a simple 'click' on a button could trigger a whole world of actions behind the scenes, and today I use React/Tailwind/Laravel to bring ideas to life. When I'm not Coding, you can find me exploring local coffee shops or gaming.",
